== How to make one WuDevice into a Z-Wave base station?

= English instructions

Burn Zwave_bridge.pde in pde folder to the board

Could use Arduino.app or the official Arduino IDE

Run the following command to connect to the base station board

    ./testrtt -d PORT

= 中文

燒錄Zwave_bridge.pde到node(以node當base station)

連接zwave node

    ./testrtt -d "設備port"

(ex設備port:/dev/ttyACM0)

== How to remove entries from Z-Wave base station routing table? (controller initdata)

= English instructions

First use the command to verify if the node ID is responding

    ack basic set ID 0

if the command is successful, OK message will appear

if the command failed, no ACK message will appear

Then run this command to verify if the node actually failed

    isfail ID

If the return value could look something like this [0 98]

The first value indicates whether the node is alive, 0 means alive, 1 means dead

The second value is the checksum

Doesn't matter if the node is actually alive, you can remove it now by running

    removefail ID


Reset the controller by running

    controller reset

= 中文

檢查節點是否有通

    ack basic set "節點ID" 0

成功出現OK

失敗出現no ACK

檢查節點是否存活

    ack basic get "節點ID"

    isfail "節點ID"

回傳值[0 98]

第一碼0代表節點活著，1代表節點失效，

第二碼98代表checksum

移除失效節點

    removefail "節點ID"

重置base station

    controller reset

== How to add or remove a node from base station routing table

= English instructions

How to add a node to the network?

Burn Zwave.pde in pde folder to the target node

Go to Arduino Serial monitor and press l

Then to add this node to the network, enter base station and run the commands

    network add

Once the sucess messages are seen on both side, go to Arduino Serial monitor and press L

THen run the command at base station

    network stop


How to remove a node from the network?

    network delete

燒錄Zwave.pde到節點上

新增節點到base station

1.base station輸入指令network add

2.節點進入learning mode(燒錄Zwave.pde後執行l進入學習模式，L停止學習)

從base station移除節點

1.base station輸入指令network delete

2.節點進入learning mode(燒錄Zwave.pde後執行l進入學習模式，L停止學習)

輸入r可以將節點reset(清除之前的學習資訊)
