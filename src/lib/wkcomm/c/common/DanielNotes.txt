Questions for routing_wukong.c

- Line 133 and 134: Is S1 equal to s1? C is case sensitive and they
  should be different.
They are actually different, but I didn't see any 'S1' appears in routing_wukong.c.

- L140: Will this line block the function?
No, it won't block the function.
"radio_wifi_client_connect" tries to establish connecion between itself and specified IP.
Once it fails, it returns.

- Line 151: what's a wifi-server?
WiFi server indicates the device itself.
Because every device with wifi module is always listening for connection requirement.
'wifi_server_disconnect(uint8_t cid)' just closes the connection between specified cid and itself.

- What's cid?
There is a struct array named "sock_table" in radio_wifi.c,
and it is used to store related info about each established connection.
cid stands for "connection id", and it is just a index of "sock_table".

- RT_FAILED is used in several place:
  * Line 176: no path
  * Line 195: cannot find wifi cid based on LID.
- Line 199: the transmission is not actually completed. What's the
  return of radio_wifi_send()? The function return success when the
  data are written into UART port. It may fail to reach the
  destination.
  radio_wifi_send(): Lin 705, radio_wifi.c
The return value of radio_wifi_send() is always WIFI_SUCCESS.
I think guan-fan assumes the send will be successful if the connection is still existed.
I am not sure how the older wifi module works, but I agree that the transmittion may fails.

- Line 202: the failure is casused by not finding IP address, not
  transmission. In this case, delay the transmission will not fix the
  problem.
I think it works.
If the connection is missing, wifi_table_to_ip() will call radio_wifi_client_connect()
and try to establish a new connection.

- Line 209: is this line sending the failure message to someone?
failed_handle() puts packet which is failed to send into a buffer, and gives the packet a deadline.
Then failed_handle() calls routing_broadcast_ask() to get a new route from neighbors.
And in each periodic update, the buffer will be checked to see whether there is a new route for the packet.
If the new route existed, the packet is resent.
The packet will be dropped if the time is up and the new route is still missing.

- Line 213: if the transmission fails, variable ret has no value.
If the transmission fails, the value of ret is RT_FAILED.

- Line 190 ~ 215: this is no error handling when the next interface is
  wifi but wifi radio is NOT used. Same problem applies for other
  radio.
I think it might be a problem.
