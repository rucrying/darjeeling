// The structure for the vm and base libraries is a bit of a mess.
// VM depends on base to supply it with identifiers for certain classes,
// mostly for exceptions it wants to throw. Base on the other hand,
// depends on vm for various reasons (stack manipulation, creating
// objects, etc).
// To 'solve' this circular dependency, I split the header files for vm
// into a separate project, so base can build on those, and then the
// real vm set can build on base.
// Maybe they should just be a single library, but for now I'd prefer
// to keep them separated since its always easier to merge things than
// to split them again.
